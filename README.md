# Bifurcation diagrams in Python

Following the online course "[Introduction to Dynamical Systems and Chaos](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/91-introduction-to-dynamical-systems-and-chaos)" from Santa Fe Institute, I decided to attempt my own implementation of bifurcation diagrams.

### Pre-requisite

Tested on OsX:
- Python 3.65
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Setup

### Run

From you terminal, cd into the project folder then run Jupyter notebook:

```
cd project_folder
jupyter notebook
```

A browser window will open. Select "Bifurcation diagram.ipynb" to run the notebook.
